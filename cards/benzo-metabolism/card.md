# Benzodiazepines Metabolism by the Liver

**Take Home Point**

-   **ALL benzodiazepines are metabolized by the liver. **Some are just metabolized by different pathways that are less dependent on global liver function.
- The ‘LOT’ drugs are those metabolized mostly by conjugation.
  - **L** – **<span class="drug">Lorazepam</span>** 
  - **O** –** <span class="drug">Oxazepam</span>**
  - **T** – **<span class="drug">Temazepam</span>**

-   'LOT' drugs do not have active metabolites after hepatic conjugation, and therefore have minimally affected half-lives in patients with liver disease. 

The rest of the benzodiazepines are primarily metabolized via hepatic CYP-mediated oxidation. 

- May cause prolonged duration of effect in patients with marked liver impairment
- Examples of drugs with active metabolites: 
  - **<span class="drug">diazepam</span>**
  - **<span class="drug">clonazepam</span>**
  - **<span class="drug">midazolam</span>**

- Some practitioners like to take advantage of the longer duration of action and active metabolites.
