# Benzodiazepines Metabolism by the Liver

**Take Home Point**

-   **ALL benzodiazepines are metabolized by the liver. **Some are just metabolized by different pathways that are less dependent on global liver function.
- The ‘LOT’ drugs are those metabolized mostly by conjugation.
  - **L** – **<span class="drug">Lorazepam</span>** 
  - **O** –** <span class="drug">Oxazepam</span>**
  - **T** – **<span class="drug">Temazepam</span>**

-   'LOT' drugs do not have active metabolites after hepatic conjugation, and therefore have minimally affected half-lives in patients with liver disease. 

The rest of the benzodiazepines are primarily metabolized via hepatic CYP-mediated oxidation. These may have prolonged duration of effect in patients with marked liver impairment, particularly the drugs with active metabolites such as **<span class="drug">diazepam</span>**, **<span class="drug">clonazepam</span>**, and **<span class="drug">midazolam</span>**. Some practitioners like to take advantage of the longer duration of action and active metabolites. Others prefer to have more predictable kinetics in patients with liver disease and stick with the ‘LOT’ options.
