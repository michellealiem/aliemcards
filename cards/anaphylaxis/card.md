# Anaphylaxis

**Definition**: A serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and might cause death

**Mechanism**: IgE-mediated immune reaction

**Pearl**: Hypotension is NOT required to diagnose anaphylaxis.

**Triggers**: Almost any food, allergens, or medications can be a trigger.

**Common culprits**:

-   Antibiotics (especially beta-lactams)
-   NSAIDs
-   Peanuts
-   Shellfish

**Organ involvement**: 

-   Skin 80-90%
-   Respiratory 70%
-   Gastrointestinal 45%
-   Cardiovascular 45%
-   Central nervous system 15%

**Biphasic anaphylaxis pattern**: 2nd flare may occur despite trigger removed (typically within 72 hours of onset)

## Diagnostic criteria


> Highly likely if **1 or 3 criteria** fulfilled per 2nd National Institute of Allergy and ID/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network

1.  Acute onset (min-several hrs), involving skin, mucosa, or both (hives, flushing, pruritis, angioedema) AND at least 1 of the following:
    -   Respiratory compromise: shortness of breath, wheezing, stridor, hypoxemia, reduced PEF
    -   Reduced BP or associated sx of end-organ dysfunction: hypotonia, syncope, incontinence

2.  Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to likely allergen:
    1.  Involvement of skin-mucosal tissue: hives, itching, flushing
    2.  Respiratory compromise: shortness of breath, wheezing, stridor, hypoxema, reduced PEF
    3.  Reduced BP or associated dx: hypotonia, syncope, incontinence
    4.  Persistent GI sx: cramping, abdominal pain, vomiting

3.  Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen
    -   Infants/children: Low SBP (age specific) or &gt; 30% decrease in SBP

      - Age 1 mo - 1 yr: SBP &lt; 70 mmHg
      - Age 1 yr - 10 yr: SBP &lt; 70 mmHg + [2 x age]

    -   Adults: SBP &lt;90 mmHg or &gt;30% decrease in person's baseline

## ED management

-   Supine position, ABCs
-   **IM <span class="drug">epinephrine</span> STAT**. Repeat every 5-15 min if refractory
    -   0.3-0.5 mg for adults = 0.3-0.5 mL 0f 1:1000 concentration of epinephrine
    -   0.15 mg for patient wt &lt; 30 kg
    -   **IM injection into lateral thigh** - quickest absorption centrally
-   IV fluids 2 liters
-   H1 antagonist (eg. <span class="drug">diphenhydramine</span>)
-   H2 antagonist (eg. <span class="drug">ranitidine</span>)
-   Glucocorticoids (eg. <span class="drug">Methylprednisolone</span>; may blunt biphasic response)
-   <span class="drug">Albuterol</span> (beta-agonist) nebulizer for wheezing/lower airway obstruction
-   Consider: <span class="drug">Glucagon</span> 3.5-5 mg IV if refractory to epinephrine and on beta-blockers
-   If discharging patient home after observation, **prescribe <span class="drug">epinephrine pen</span>**
