# Blunt Cerebrovascular Injuries (BCVI)

**Classic mechanisms of injury**

-   **Carotid artery injury (CAI)**: Hyperextension of neck resulting in stretching of carotid artery over lateral processes of C1-C3
-   **Vertebral artery injury (VAI)**: Fracture through transverse process of C-spine, or hyperextension-stretch injury

**Treatment**

-   Antithrombotic agent (<span class="drug">heparin</span> vs <span class="drug">aspirin</span>)

## Denver Screening Criteria for BCVI 

**Signs / symptoms of BCVI**

-   Arterial hemorrhage from neck, nose, or mouth
-   Cervical bruit in patients &lt;50 years old
-   Expanding cervical hematoma
-   Focal neurologic deficit (TIA, hemiparesis, vertebrobasilar sx, Horner’s) 
-   Neurologic exam incongruous with head CT findings
-   CVA on CT or MRI 

**Risk factors for BCVI**

-   LeFort II or III facial fracture
-   C-spine fracture patterns: subluxation, fx extending into transverse foramen, fx involving C1-C3
-   Basilar skull fracture with carotid canal involvement
-   Petrous bone fracture
-   Diffuse axonal injury with GCS &lt; 6
-   Near-hanging with anoxic brain injury
-   Clothesline type injury or seat belt abrasion with significant swelling, pain, or altered mental status

## Imaging Choice

-   **Gold standard**: Digital subtraction angiography
-   **Accepted first-line imaging**: CT angiography (at least 16-slice scanner)
-   **Alternative**: MRI (does not need contrast), may be less sensitive and less specific than CT
-   NOTE: A simple seat-belt sign along the neck does not warrant a CT angiogram. Patients with higher risk findings such as significant pain, tenderness, swelling, and/or a bruit may need imaging.

## BCVI Grading and Incidence of CVA complication

| Grade | Definition  | CVA Rate: Carotid   | CVA: Rate Vertebral: |
|:-------|-------------|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
| **1**     | Irregularity of vessel wall, or dissection/intramural hematoma with &lt;25%luminal stenosis                               | 3%            | 6%             |
| **2**     | Intraluminal thrombus or raised intimal flap is visualized, or dissection/intramural hematoma with ≥25% luminal narrowing | 14%           | 38%            |
| **3**     | Pseudoaneurysm                                                                                                             | 26%           | 27%            |
| **4**     | Vessel occlusion                                                                                                           | 50%           | 28%            |
| **5**     | Vessel transection                                                                                                         | 100%          | 100%           |

Risk of undiagnosed BVCI: Delayed CVA

- May occur hours to 14 years later 
- Majority develop CVA symptoms in 10-72 hours
